# Aircraft Engine Remaining Useful Life (RUL) Prediction Project Documentation

## Introduction and Project Objective

This project implements a comprehensive system for predicting the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of aircraft engines using advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques. The primary objective is to develop a reliable predictive model that can estimate the remaining useful life of an aircraft engine based on sensor data collected during operation.

### Dataset Used
- **NASA C-MAPSS Turbofan Engine Degradation Dataset (FD001)**
- **Training file**: `train_FD001.txt` (historical degradation data)
- **Test file**: `test_FD001.txt` (data for final validation)
- **RUL file**: `RUL_FD001.txt` (ground truth RUL values for testing)

## Reasoning and Methodological Approach

### 1. Problem Analysis

The RUL prediction problem is fundamentally a **time series regression problem**. The key characteristics of the problem are:

- **Temporal nature**: Sensor data evolves over time
- **Progressive degradation**: The engine deteriorates gradually
- **Multi-sensor**: Utilization of 21 different sensors
- **Inter-engine variability**: Each engine has unique characteristics

### 2. Solution Architecture

The project was developed in two progressive versions:

#### Base Version (`aircraft_engine_rul_prediction.py`)
Implements a classic but robust approach with:
- Two-layer LSTM to capture temporal dependencies
- Preprocessing with MinMaxScaler
- Fixed-length sequences (50 timesteps)
- Standard evaluation metrics (RMSE, MAE)

#### Advanced Version (`production_ready_rul_predictor.py`)
Implements state-of-the-art techniques for production use:
- **Model ensemble** for greater robustness
- **Uncertainty quantification** for informed decisions
- **Advanced feature engineering** to extract more information
- **Attention mechanism** for dynamic focus on data
- **Data quality monitoring** for robust deployment

## Machine Learning Pipeline Phases

### Phase 1: Data Loading and Analysis

```python
# Data structure
- unit_number: Engine ID
- time_in_cycles: Temporal cycle
- setting_1-3: Operational parameters
- sensor_1-21: Sensor readings
```

**Reasoning**: Before processing data, it's essential to understand its structure and quality. Preliminary analysis reveals:
- Some columns have zero or very low variance
- Presence of outliers in some sensors
- Need for normalization due to different scales

### Phase 2: RUL Calculation for Training Data

```python
RUL = max_cycle_per_engine - current_cycle
```

**Reasoning**: For each engine in the training dataset, RUL is calculated as the difference between the maximum cycle reached (failure point) and the current cycle. This creates a decreasing target over time representing remaining useful life.

### Phase 3: Preprocessing and Feature Engineering

#### Base Version:
- Removal of low-variance columns
- MinMax normalization on all sensors
- Creation of temporal sequences

#### Advanced Version:
- **Rolling statistics**: Moving averages, standard deviations, min/max
- **Trend features**: First differences to capture degradation velocity
- **Cross-sensor correlations**: Ratios between sensors to capture interactions
- **Cumulative features**: Cumulative sums to capture degradation accumulation

**Reasoning**: Feature engineering is crucial because:
1. Raw sensors might not capture complex patterns
2. Temporal statistics reveal degradation trends
3. Sensor interactions provide information about system behavior

### Phase 4: Temporal Sequence Creation

```python
sequence_length = 50  # Temporal window
```

**Reasoning**: 
- LSTMs require fixed-length sequences
- 50 timesteps represent a good compromise between:
  - Sufficient temporal context for complex patterns
  - Computational efficiency
  - Data availability (some engines have few cycles)

### Phase 5: Model Architecture

#### Base Version - Standard LSTM:
```python
LSTM(100, return_sequences=True) -> Dropout(0.2) ->
LSTM(50) -> Dropout(0.2) -> Dense(1, linear)
```

#### Advanced Version - Ensemble with Attention:
```python
# Model 1: Attention-based LSTM
LSTM -> LSTM -> Attention Mechanism -> Dense

# Model 2: Bidirectional LSTM
Bidirectional LSTM -> Dense

# Model 3: CNN-LSTM Hybrid
Conv1D -> LSTM -> Dense
```

**Reasoning for Ensemble**:
1. **Diversity**: Different architecture types capture different aspects
2. **Robustness**: Reduces overfitting of a single model
3. **Uncertainty quantification**: Variance between predictions indicates confidence

### Phase 6: Training with Advanced Techniques

#### Callbacks Used:
- **EarlyStopping**: Prevents overfitting
- **ReduceLROnPlateau**: Optimizes learning
- **ModelCheckpoint**: Saves the best model

**Reasoning**: 
- Training temporal models is subject to overfitting
- Dynamic learning rate adaptation improves convergence
- Saving the best model ensures optimal performance

### Phase 7: Evaluation and Metrics

#### Standard Metrics:
- **RMSE**: Root Mean Squared Error
- **MAE**: Mean Absolute Error
- **R²**: Coefficient of determination

#### Advanced Metrics (Production Version):
- **Directional Accuracy**: Accuracy in predicting trend direction
- **Confidence Interval Coverage**: Coverage of confidence intervals
- **Risk Metrics**: Over/underestimation rates
- **Reliability Score**: Overall reliability score

**Reasoning for Advanced Metrics**:
- In industrial contexts, underestimating RUL is more critical
- Uncertainty quantification helps in maintenance decisions
- Confidence interval coverage validates prediction reliability

## Innovations and Advanced Techniques

### 1. Attention Mechanism
```python
attention = Dense(attention_units, activation='tanh')(lstm_output)
attention = Dense(1, activation='softmax')(attention)
context = Multiply()([lstm_output, attention])
```

**Reasoning**: Attention allows the model to dynamically focus on the most relevant timesteps for prediction, improving interpretability and performance.

### 2. Uncertainty Quantification
```python
ensemble_predictions = [model.predict(X) for model in models]
mean_prediction = np.mean(ensemble_predictions, axis=0)
uncertainty = np.std(ensemble_predictions, axis=0)
```

**Reasoning**: In critical applications like aircraft maintenance, it's essential to know prediction confidence to make informed decisions.

### 3. Intelligent Feature Engineering
- **Rolling Statistics**: Capture local trends and variations
- **Cross-sensor Ratios**: Reveal complex interactions
- **Trend Features**: Identify accelerations in degradation

**Reasoning**: Raw sensors provide limited information. Engineered features extract hidden patterns that significantly improve performance.

## Production Pipeline

### 2. Real-time Inference
```python
def real_time_inference(sensor_data):
    # Automatic preprocessing
    # Ensemble prediction
    # Risk assessment
    # Confidence intervals
```

### 3. Risk Management
- **LOW RISK**: RUL > 100 cycles
- **MEDIUM RISK**: 50 < RUL ≤ 100 cycles  
- **HIGH RISK**: RUL ≤ 50 cycles
